RESIP: REmote Sensing and Iimage Processing in IDL-ENVI are codes developed by Victor Gutierrez (vhg2103@columbia.edu). 

If used for any publication, they should be cited as:

Guti√©rrez-Velez, VH, DeFries, R. 2013. Annual multi-resolution detection of land cover conversion to oil palm in the Peruvian Amazon. Remote Sensing of Environment. 129: 154-167.

They can certainly be improved so if you find a way, please do it in the corresponding github file so others can use them.
